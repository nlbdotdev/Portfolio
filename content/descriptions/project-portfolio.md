### About

I decided to work in Svelte because almost all my course work at the time was in React. I wanted to challenge myself to get comfortable with a new (though fairly similar) framework, and I liked the design philosophy behind Svelte.

### Deployment

This project is deployed as a static site via namecheap hosting. I've setup a deployment branch on github which is a subtree with the origin at public/. To update this site I simply have to push to the subtree, then connect to my namecheap file server via ssh and pull.

I started out by mocking up some designs in Figma, attempting to figure out how to display my games portfolio. The most challenging part was coming up with a good solution to preview both mobile and desktop games. I tried a few layouts for both the game page and the portfolio page.

Once I had a few designs to choose from, I got to work implementing the game pages. Feeling inspired by some examples on codepen, I built a phone and laptop frame out of pure CSS. I also implemented basic routing with page.js.

The theme felt OK, but it felt a bit bare, and I wanted something more creative for a personal site. I started by switching to a dark theme, and then adding more color.

These layouts also ended up being too wide to have a large enough game preview windows, so I adjusted them to the current layout.

With a functional games section, I moved on to the web page, starting with the responsive header and splash image. I then fleshed out the skills section. At this point I revisited the game page, which needed more work to fit the theme. I updated the portfolio and showcase template to match the theme, and converted the game pages to modals. Here I also did a big responsiveness pass to make sure the site looked good across devices.

Building the data structure and component composition for the games portfolio made implementing the web projects fairly straight forward. I also implemented a contact page using formspree.

### A deeper dive

#### Device Components

Initially the Phone.svelte and Laptop.svelte component had no shared code. I drew them up quick and dirty, and they needed some work to fit more robust use cases. I started by switching the device content to a component which each device could use. I setup DeviceContent.svelte so that it could display either a static image, a gif, or an embedded preview of the game depending on props and if the user is on an appropriate device.

#### Project Composition

For each category of project (web projects, other web projects, game projects), I built an array of objects in stores.js with all relevant data. This would make it easy to pull in and filter all games based on tag, or other defined parameters.

#### Responsive Navbar

The navbar took a bit of trial and error to find what worked. Initially I tried automatically collapsing it once you had scrolled past a certain point, but it didn’t look right. I also experimented with some scroll-jacking but thankfully decided against it. Ultimately, I realized it would probably look best to adjust the angle in real time. Making that work was easier than I thought, I just had to define a start and end position, and adjust the skew angle according to the scroll position relative to that area.

#### Angled Sections

When refactoring to the dark theme, I came up with the idea of the angled navbar which I really liked. But I also had to bring the rest of the website in line. I tried a lot of solutions for drawing angled backgrounds in CSS: borders, angled boxes, clip-path, transform, etc. I found a more elegant solution with the psuedo elements ::before and ::after, using clip-path to display shadows appropriately. Finally, I built the Section.svelte component with top and bottom props to conditionally render the angled borders.

### Old Portfolios

As mentioned in the description, I’ve built a few portfolio sites with Wordpress before. Here are the archived pages:
